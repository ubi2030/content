# The Network State
### How to start a new country.

A network state is the sequel to the nation state. 

It is a social network with:  
 1) a clear leader,       
 2) an integrated cryptocurrency,  
 3) a definite purpose,  
 4) a sense of national consciousness, and  
 5) a plan to crowdfund territory.     

That clear leader is the founding influencer who peacefully organizes an online community dedicated to a proposition. This community eventually buys land in the physical world. Crucially, that land is not necessarily [contiguous](/how-to-start-a-new-country).

A network state is:  
   
    a) a country you can start from your computer,  
    b) an archipelago of digitally-linked enclaves,  
    c) a territory you can peacefully acquire but not violently conquer, and  
    d) a group organized by geodesic rather than geographic distance.  

## a) A Country You Can Start From Your Computer

A network state is a city-state in the cloud that recruits like a startup. 

In the modern era you can boot up a billion dollar company from a laptop, 
a million person online community, a new digital currency, or even a new city! 
Anyone can choose to become a founder at any time, and take on the [immense](https://a16z.com/2011/10/08/nobody-cares/)
[stress](https://future.a16z.com/the-entrepreneurial-struggle/)
and risk of trying to build something from scratch. Or they can choose to remain a 
"citizen" and be gainfully employed by a founder, or by a vehicle that a founder once [set up](/founding-vs-inheriting).
![founding-vs-inheriting.png](img/founding-vs-inheriting.png "founding-vs-inheriting.png")

What if we could generalize that beyond companies, communities, and currencies?!

Suppose we separate the world into _founders_ of network states, and
_citizens_. Just as you can go from being a Google employee to taking
on the insanity of founding a company, you can go from being a citizen to a founder. 
Just as you can transition from founding a company to selling to Google, 
enjoying the easy life as an employee, you can transition from founder to citizen, hanging up the cleats for a time. 

In other words, between any two moments in time, all four of the
following
[transitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-transition_table)
are possible:

 1. _Citizen to Founder_. Gather an online community, write up a founding document, 
    create a cryptocurrency, and declare your intent to start a network state. 
    This seems quixotic. But think about Satoshi Nakamoto's plan to start a new currency in 2009, 
    and how utopian it seemed at the time. If the process of instantiating the first network state
    meets with success, if this zero-to-one works, it will eventually become a template: 
    a country anyone can start from your computer, beginning by building a following.

2. _Founder to Citizen_. You may not want to remain a founder forever. 
    Heavy lies the crown! As we will see, unlike modern nation states, 
    but like [historical ones](https://foreignpolicy.com/2012/06/05/why-dont-countries-buy-territory-like-they-used-to/),
    network states are built for full or partial M&A. So you can sell
    a network state to another network state, which transitions the
    logins of all your citizens to a new system. Or you can shut it
    down, ideally with some notice such that your citizens/users have
    time to find a new network state they can gain citizenship in.		

![passport-power.png](img/passport-power.png "passport-power.png")

 3. _Citizen to Citizen_. You join a network state, and remain a
	citizen. Or you acquire dual citizenship, or N-th citizenship, in
	another network state - usually by buying and holding a sufficient
	amount of that network state's coin, as well as satisfying other
	requirements like [participation](https://poap.xyz) and
	[civility](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1451354756639723523). Different
	network states may have different reciprocity provisions, just
	like nation states and social networks do. For example, a US
	passport allows you to enter some countries, but not others. And
	Quora allows you to login with Facebook or Google, but not vice
	versa.

 4. _Founder to Founder_. You continue running the network state you
	founded, or you sell it or shut it down and start a new
	one. Perhaps the first such state is focused on veganism, while
	the second on life extension. Just like Evan Williams did Blogger,
	then Twitter, then Medium - all iterations on a theme, each
	informed by the previous one - it may be possible for a suitably
	talented administrator to do the Plymouth Colony, then
	Massachusetts, then the US all within one lifetime. The v1, v2,
	and v3 of countries rather than companies. The history 
	[mid-1800s American
	communes](https://rowman.com/ISBN/9780739105207/All-Things-New-American-Communes-and-Utopian-Movements-1860-1914)
	is highly relevant.

This is a vision of global equality of opportunity. It is the modern version of
Jefferson's natural aristocracy. And it's an improvement over the
legitimating myth that "anyone can become president of the United
States." Only ~4% of the world is American
and only a subset of those people satisfy the age, birth, and
residency [requirements](https://www.usa.gov/presidents) to become
president. 

![us-rules-world.png](img/us-rules-world.png "us-rules-world.png")

So long as the US still [rules the
world](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/06/us-military-bases-around-the-world-119321/),
most of the people the US rules cannot themselves rise
to rule the US. In fact, there have been only 46
US presidents (all of whom are American), but there are thousands
of billionaires (most of whom are now [not
American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_number_of_billionaires)). 
So, it is much more realistic to become a tech billionare than to become president.

![global-billionaire-list.png](img/global-billionaire-list.png "global-billionaire-list.png")

Similarly, now that Satoshi made it possible to start a new digital
currency, it is much easier to found a new cryptocurrency than to
become head of the Federal Reserve. The American establishment would
never have picked Vitalik Buterin over Jerome Powell, but the young
Canadian is on key dimensions a far more accomplished macroeconomist
than the American sexagenarian. Buterin founded an economy, while
Powell simply [inherited it](/founding-vs-inheriting).

So, instead of the false hope of getting elected US president, a role
available only to 40-something people in history, or the even more
difficult path of becoming Fed Chair, an opportunity for only 16
appointees, one can much more realistically found a billion dollar
company or coin from one's computer.

![start-community.png](img/start-community.png "start-community.png")
![start-company.png](img/start-company.png "start-company.png")
![start-currency.png](img/start-currency.png "start-currency.png")

By extending this concept, we allow anyone in the world with an
internet connection (which will soon be everyone) to become not just a
tech founder, or a protocol founder, but a network state founder.
Whether the next Washington is Brazilian, Indian, Nigerian, or Eastern
European, this mechanism lets them rise to global leadership. It
permits a positive-sum avenue for the politically ambitious. But it
also allows anyone who doesn't desire the stress of leadership, or
just doesn't desire it at this point in time, to simply remain a
citizen and pick from the available nation and network state jurisdictions.

## b) An Archipelago of Digitally-Linked Enclaves

A network state is a DAO that materializes in patches of earth.

Look at [Southeast Asia](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1430043293518221312) on a
map. Several of these countries are clusters of islands separated by
the ocean. ![Map of Southeast Asia](img/map-of-southeast-asia.jpeg "Map of Southeast Asia")

These aren't [convex
sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_set). 

![convex-set.png](img/convex-set.png "convex-set.png")
![non-convex-set.png](img/non-convex-set.png "non-convex-set.png")

There are parts of Indonesia that are closer to Malaysia than to other
parts of Indonesia. Yet we
superimpose the abstraction of a nation state. Two people within the geographic boundaries of a state delimited on a
map are citizens of the same country. They are subject to the same law, with
logins on the same government services, even if they
may be [physically
closer](https://www.wired.com/2013/11/software-is-reorganizing-the-world-and-cloud-formations-could-lead-to-physical-nations/)
to a citizen of another country.

![singpass.png](img/singpass.png "singpass.png")

What if we extend this concept? What if those islands were separated
not by the ocean, but by the internet? What if they were scattered all around the
world? That's a visual of a network state. Contemporary precedents
include coworking communities and the [offices of
Google](https://about.google/locations/?region=europe&office=london-6ps):
globally distributed, networked real estate gated by the [common
login](https://venturebeat.com/2020/04/20/google-rolls-out-beyondcorp-for-secure-remote-network-access-without-a-vpn/).

![google-offices.png](img/google-offices.png "google-offices.png")

## c) A Territory You Can Peacefully Acquire but Not Violently Conquer
Once we visualize a network state as a combination of 
(a) a country you can start from your computer – a digital social network with an integrated cryptocurrency – 
and (b) a physical network, or archipelago, of distributed enclaves, 
we realize that it is much easier to acquire than to conquer. 
  
### 1. Territory is easier to peacefully acquire. 
  
   *i. Digital acquisition is like selling Instagram to Facebook.*
   
   The digital logins of the two services are integrated and citizens in each network state
   get access to the other's apps and physical territory. This is a modern analogue to the Louisiana Purchase 
   or the purchase of Alaska. It's also feasible to simply sell a subnetwork - perhaps a defined geographical location, 
   or those interested in changing citizenship. This is similar to Singapore’s independence from Malaysia. 
   Finally, it is also feasible to spin-off a subnetwork into its own network, like the UK exiting from the EU.
   
   ![lousiana-purchase.jpeg](img/lousiana-purchase.jpeg "lousiana-purchase.jpeg")
     
   *ii. Physical acquisition is like Google buying new offices.*

   The smart locks just get a software update and now open all the doors and gates. 
   The branding changes too to be consistent with the new unified entity, 
   like in a restaurant chain, or the real estate footprint of a REIT. 
   After one network state acquires the other, all citizens from one network state can enter the 
   territory of the other. Various kinds of reciprocity relationships with other network 
   states may need to be renegotiated, just as many corporate deals have change-of-control provisions,
   but this too is straightforward so long as it is anticipated.
   
   ![restaurant-chains-map.jpeg](img/restaurant-chains-map.jpeg "restaurant-chains-map.jpeg")

Both can theoretically be done with current legal infrastructure. 
It's just like one multinational acquiring the digital, physical, and human 
resources of another. By contrast, it extends to people's residences rather than
simply their offices. Acquired people also become citizens rather than employees,
though they can always leave for any new network state that admits them.

Over time, however, the digital infrastructure for each network state should live on a blockchain. 
This enables recording of all real estate transactions, maintenance of citizen 
records, and management of private keys in a globally consistent way across 
legacy nation state jurisdictions. The problem of post-acquisition integration mostly 
then reduces to porting over the records from one blockchain to another.

This is how we extend the corporate concept of change-of-control to polities. 
It's a recipe for nonviolent competition between countries, where peace treaties 
between would-be rebels and current incumbents are signed via M&A.
  
### 2. Territory is harder to violently conquer.

The network state reduces violence on another dimension. 
Network states are hard to conquer thanks to (i) geographical decentralization and 
(ii) physical invisibility.
  
  *i.  Network states are geographically decentralized.*  
  Look at a map of France that includes its [islands in the South
  Pacific](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overseas_France).

![global-france-map.png](img/global-france-map.png "global-france-map.png")

  It’s difficult to invade or nuke the whole thing at once. 
  The geographical distribution of the network itself is a deterrent
  to physical force. Just as in the case of cryptocurrency, 
  the decentralization deters violence.
  
  *ii. Network states are physically invisible.*

  This is much more subtle. Right now,
  you can see the physical border zone between France & Germany on a
  map. But you can't visualize the border zone between Twitter &
  Facebook. That is, which people are on the "border" of Twitter and
  Facebook, in the sense that they have accounts on both sites?

![facebook-map.jpeg](img/facebook-map.jpeg "facebook-map.jpeg")

  This might seem like a trivial concept, but isn't. The Twitter and
  Facebook networks are each bigger than France or Germany -
  combined. However, social network membership is invisible to all but
  the network operators. There's no public list of all Facebook and
  Twitter members. Only Facebook can generate a [map like
  this](https://i.stack.imgur.com/6dXmx.jpg).

  This has immense implications. You couldn't have nationalism itself
  without maps of physical space. For example, think about 54° 40' or Fight, 
  which made literal reference to latitude. You couldn't have
  that kind of border dispute without being able to visualize a 
  border. People had to see the map to be able to fight over it.

So, because citizenship in a network state is invisible to a
satellite, at least without the consent of the network state operator,
these [imagined
communities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagined_community) are
_[invisible
countries](https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300221626/invisible-countries)_. It's
the return of secret societies, at scale, as _secret
states_. Network states can thus reduce violence by
encrypting the map itself; you can't hit what you can't see.

## d) A Group Organized By Geodesic Rather than Geographic Distance

Snapchat lies on a straight line with the dissolution of the nation state.
Why? People share intimate moments with others 3000 miles away, 
while they often don't know the names of their next door neighbors in an anonymous apartment complex. 

The underlying premise of the Westphalian nation state is that people who live 
near each other will share the same values and therefore agree on laws. 
In other words, the nation state is geographically premised. 
Yet, people actually share values with people who are close to them in their social network...not in their physical space. 

We can quantify this. Consider (1) the [great circle
distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great-circle_distance) vs. 
(2) the [geodesic
distance](https://faculty.ucr.edu/~hanneman/nettext/C7_Connection.html#geodesic). 
We are transitioning from a primarily 
great-circle-driven world to a geodesic-driven world. Thus, we need to 
reconceptualize the state as a primarily digital entity – a network state.

![great-circle-distance.png](img/great-circle-distance.png "great-circle-distance.png")
![geodesic-distance.jpg](img/geodesic-distance.jpg "geodesic-distance.jpg")

**1. The great circle distance is the distance between two points on the surface of the earth.**

It's the distance as the crow flies. To a first approximation,
this is how far apart people are in the physical world across 
the visible geographic borders of the nation state.

![distance-metric.png](img/distance-metric.png "distance-metric.png")

*i. For nation states, geography is primary while ideology is secondary.*

Russia's borders are (mostly) fixed. Russia was a geographical 
entity that switched its ideology in 1991, from communism to nationalism. 
Russia's borders have changed since 1991; its predecessor state, the USSR, 
extended farther out into Eastern Europe and Central Asia. 
But the Russian people have been near the Baltics, the Turks, the Eastern Europeans, 
and so on for quite a long time. Geopolitics doesn't vary that much; Russia's "competitors" for citizens have mostly stayed the same.

**2. The geodesic distance is the smallest degree of separation between two nodes in a social network.**

Importantly, the geodesic distance is just as valid a [mathematical
metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_(mathematics)#Definition)
as the great-circle distance. That means one can generate [distance
matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_matrix), and hence
maps, via techniques like [multidimensional
scaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidimensional_scaling#Classical_multidimensional_scaling). In
fact, there are entire
[conferences](http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=21262&copyownerid=34837)
devoted to cloud cartography.
[Research](http://vis.stanford.edu/jheer/projects/vizster/)
[groups](https://www.cmu.edu/joss/content/articles/volume1/Freeman.html)
present maps of online social networks - mapping not nation states but
the invisible geodesic borders of the social network. 

![social-network-map.png](img/social-network-map.png "social-network-map.png")

*i. For network states, ideology is primary while geography is secondary*

Ethereum's borders are highly fluid. Ethereum is an ideological entity 
whose primary existence is in a network. The Ethereum community holds 
meetups in places like Cancun or Shenzhen, but the physical materialization 
is evanescent while the digital community is persistent.

![russia-vs-ethereum.png](img/russia-vs-ethereum.png "russia-vs-ethereum.png")

![ethereum-vs-btc.png](img/ethereum-vs-btc.png "ethereum-vs-btc.png")

The Ethereum-to-XYZ exchange rate does vary quite a bit, 
for different values of XYZ. Solana is a new digital currency 
that has popped up on Ethereum's boundary and taken a good 
chunk of "citizens" from it, just as Ethereum itself rose in BTC terms since its inception.

This is similar to how early Facebook arose out of
nowhere and took many citizens from Gmail, before Google "closed the
borders". Of course, unlike territorial disputes, these games are not
strictly zero-sum, as the space of cryptocurrency and internet users
keeps expanding, as does the wealth to invest in different services.

![google-facebook-reciprocity-1.png](img/google-facebook-reciprocity-1.png "google-facebook-reciprocity-1.png")
![google-facebook-reciprocity-2.png](img/google-facebook-reciprocity-2.png "google-facebook-reciprocity-2.png")

The geodesic distance enables this fluidity. Individuals
and entire networks can instantly become adjacent to anyone else in a
social network. Individuals can also move around the map to become
adjacent to others in the physical world. But unlike individuals or
networks, nation states cannot do this. They cannot just move around
the map at will. The Russian state is mostly stuck with its neighbors
in a way that individual Russians, or the Telegram and Ethereum
networks (both founded by people of Russian descent), are not.

![dynamic-geography.png](img/dynamic-geography.png "dynamic-geography.png")

We can term this concept _dynamic digital geography_, after a term
Patri Friedman
[introduced](https://patrifriedman.com/old_writing/dynamic_geography.html). He
used it for seasteading, but it's easier to accomplish in the digital
world. The popularization of the metaverse makes this more than a
metaphor. The digital territory a network inhabits can instantly be
picked up and made adjacent to any other with the press of a key, just
like moving a cruise ship around the world, but even cheaper and faster.

A network state is indeed a nation built from the internet 
based on math rather than science. It’s a community aligned around 
cryptographic consensus. A polity that prizes exit above voice.
